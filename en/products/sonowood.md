## Sonowood makes your instrument sound better.

For the manufacturing of musical instruments, tropical woods are highly
esteemed thanks to high hardness and density, advanced dimensional
stability and aesthetic dark coloration. However, excessive and
unregulated exploitation has resulted in a rapidly decreasing
availability of the material. Increasingly strict governmental
regulations, such as
[CITES,](https://www.cites.org/eng/disc/species.php) aim to protect the
biodiversity. As a result, import and trade of tropical woods are
closely controlled and often only allowed with certain certificates.

This is why we have developed **Sonowood**. Sonowood matches the
favourable properties of tropical woods while being a completely legal
alternative. In addition to being environmentally friendly, the
technology offers adjustability of a wide range of parameters.

**Sonowood** is the best alternative wood for your musical instrument, made of 100% real AND indigenous wood.

  - ![icon 100% wood](/assets/logo/100.svg)

    ### The real thing

    Sonowood is NOT a composite material, it is fully authentic wood,
    with straightforward workability.

  - ![icon acoustics](/assets/logo/sound.svg)

    ### Superior acoustics

    High sound velocity, low damping. Fully approved by musicians and
    instrument makers. [→ Testimonials](/en/testimonials)

  - ![icon customizable](/assets/logo/customizable.svg)

    ### Tunable properties

    No matter if hardness, density or coloration – you choose the
    properties of your wood.

  - ![icon biodiversity](/assets/logo/biodiverse.svg)

    ### Preserving biodiversity

    Sonowood is manufactured from sustainable European wood species.

  - ![icon no legal restrictions](/assets/logo/legal.svg)

    ### No legal restrictions

    Sonowood does not contain wood species listed on CITES, therefore no
    trade and import restrictions occur.

## The science behind Sonowood

Our unique densifying technology is applicable to any possible native
wood species, depending on the individual requirements of the respective
product. The use of maple and spruce has been proven already. Current
experiments include further wood species.
