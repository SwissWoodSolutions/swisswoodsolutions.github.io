## Wilhelm Geigenbau

In March 2018, a workshop was held at Wilhelm Geigenbau. Various
international violin manufacturers got introduced to **Sonowood** and
manufactured fingerboards from the samples provided. The feedback on
processability was uniformly positive.

To finish the one-week workshop on a high note, the Pacific Quartet
Vienna held its inaugural concert with their instruments featuring
Sonowood. The musicians reacted very positively to the improved sound
characteristics of their respective instruments.

The Swiss national TV captured the results of the workshop: [see the
