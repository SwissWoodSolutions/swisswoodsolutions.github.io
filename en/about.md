Swiss Wood Solutions was founded in 2016 as a spin-off from ETH Zurich
and Empa.

Our team fuses the vast knowledge of scientists with diverse academic backgrounds. All of our team members have worked at ETH and/or Empa prior to their engagement at Swiss Wood Solutions. ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) is a globally leading science university and constantly ranks among the top universities worldwide. Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) is an interdisciplinary Swiss research institute for applied materials science with various campuses across Switzerland. We are in the advantageous position to benefit from infrastructural, technical and know-how support from these two Swiss institutions. Regardless, Swiss Wood Solutions acts as an independent company and holds its own intellectual property rights.

  ### Dr. Oliver Kläusler
  ### CEO

  has studied wood science and technology at the University of Hamburg and wrote his thesis at ETH Zurich.
  Subsequently, he worked as an R\&D engineer and project manager in the wood industry
  in Switzerland, the Czech Republic and the United States. He is the
  main inventor and developer of the production technologies for two
  Beaufort products for Audi cars. Oliver Kläusler then received his PhD in the field of high-performance bonded wooden joints for wood constructions from ETH Zurich. Following his promotion, he ran
  a research group at Empa Dübendorf and ETH Zurich. Oliver
  Kläusler is Co-founder of Swiss Wood Solutions and its first
  CEO.

  ### Gaspard Clerc
  ### Product Manager and R&D Engineer

  spent multiple years at the violin making school in Brienz, Switzerland, where he certainly acquired practical experience, but wanted to have a greater theoretical understanding of wood. He received his Master's degree as a wood engineer at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. In the meantime, he co-founded SWS to combine his interest in lutherie and research. Currently, in addition to his work at SWS, he is completing his doctorate at the Technical University of Munich.
