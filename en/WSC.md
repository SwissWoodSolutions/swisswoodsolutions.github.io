The excessive use of petroleum-based plastic products in our society leads to enormous environmental problems. Not only does their production emit a tremendous amount of greenhouse gases, but also they do cause an exorbitant waste problematic as there is a lack of sufficient recycling.

Swiss Wood Solutions offers high performance wood materials as a sustainable alternative to plastics. Domestic (European) woods are converted into high-tech materials by innovative technologies. All of our materials and technologies are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable.

As our new product, we have developed Wooden Smart Cards. These cards are made from domestic wood species such as maple, cherry, oak, spruce, figured maple and many others. They offer first class aesthetics, pleasant haptics and full functionality.

## Advantages:

• Wood-based

• Superior haptics and aesthetics

• High surface-hardness and scratch-resistance

• Various wood species and patterns enable a variety of designs

•Unique cards due to the natural wood grain

• Precise laser-customization

• Compliant with a circular economy

• Promotion of sustainable domestic forestry
