The excessive use of plastic products leads to enormous environmental problems. Not only does their production emit a tremendous amount of greenhouse gases, but also do they cause an exorbitant waste problemat as there is a lack of sufficient recycling. In many regions of the world plastic is just burned in uncontrolled fires, causing toxic gases, or simply discarded into the environment. 

Swiss Wood Solutions offers high-performance wood-based products as a sustainable alternative to plastics. Our products are manufactured from sustainable, domestic wood, which is converted into  novel materials, providing the positive wood-related customer emotions as well as the required technological functionality.
