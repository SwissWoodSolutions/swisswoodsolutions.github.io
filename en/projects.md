## Support

All of our team members have worked at ETH and/or Empa prior to their engagement at Swiss Wood Solutions. ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology)
is a globally leading science university and constantly ranks among the
top universities worldwide. Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for
Materials Science and Technology) is an interdisciplinary Swiss research
institute for applied materials science with various campuses across
Switzerland. We are in the advantageous position
to benefit from infrastructural, technical and know-how support from
these two Swiss institutions. Regardless, Swiss Wood Solutions acts as
an independent company and holds its own intellectual property
rights.

In addition to ETH Zurich and Empa, we cooperate with further public and private institutions to carry out R\&D projects.

## TEEWood project with Horizon 2020

To build up on the promising results from the two projects sponsored by
Gebert Rüf, Swiss Wood Solutions aspires to scale up the technology to
produce wood for larger stringed instruments such as guitars and cellos.
In addition, SWS aims to evaluate production for percussion instruments
and expand the application fields of the technology to wooden sports
equipment. For this purpose, SWS filed an application for financial
support by the European research and innovation program Horizon 2020.
**Created and financed by the European Union, Horizon 2020 couples
research and innovation to tackle societal challenges and deliver
economic growth.** For promising science projects and derived business
ideas, nearly 80 billion of funding are available from 2014 to 2020.

In cooperation with [accelopment](http://www.accelopment.com) a service
provider specialized on applications for public funding programs, SWS
filed a submission titled TEEWood (Technologically Enhanced European
Wood for Substituting Endangered Tropical Woods). With the constructive
help of accelopment, SWS completed the highly complex and time-consuming
application process in October 2017. To our greatest delight, the
submission was approved and the company received a grant of 1.5
million. Proof of competitive product properties, promising market
opportunities and growth potential helped secure the funds starting in
February 2018 and running through January 2020.

The upscale of the developed technology targeted in the TEEWood project
with Horizon 2020 is expected to bear a range of impacts. Most
importantly, the project is expected to solve the raw material scarcity
problem of tropical wood-dependent industries such as the musical
instrument industry. At the same, the customer benefits from a high
performance material with custom-made physical properties, which comes
along without any ethical issues and trade restrictions. Ecologically, a
successful TEEWood project will make a precious contribution to save
botanical diversity and enhance sustainable forestry in tropical areas.
On a global political level, the project targets to reduce the
incentives for illegal overexploitation of tropical forests as well as
for piracy and corruption in affected countries. From a cultural
perspective, the TEEWood project is expected to save the traditional
instrument manufacturing profession by providing a suitable and legal
raw material.

## Swiss Ebony project with the Gebert Rüf Foundation

Since March 2016 Swiss Wood Solutions has been financially supported by
the Gebert Rüf Foundation. The private funding agency **aims to boost
entrepreneurial projects in Switzerland, which are committed to achieve
an impact in current science and innovation challenges.** Gebert Rüf has
funded two projects at Swiss Wood Solutions. In the Swiss Ebony
project, SWS succeeded to achieve dimensional stability of densified
wood materials. The positive experimental results delivered the proof of
concept and confirmed feasibility for the application of the material in
the musical instrument market.

In the Swiss Ebony II project, which is set to run until June 2018, SWS
targets the fine-tuning of physical and acoustics properties of the
densified wood material. The adjustability of crucial parameters such as
density and sound-propagation velocity enables SWS to acquire unique
selling propositions in the musical instrument market. Thanks to the
generous support by Gebert Rüf, Swiss Wood Solutions has established and
initiated pilot production. Technology readiness level 6 (TRL 6) has
been reached, implying the accomplishment of the prototyping phase. For
violins and violas, market readiness has been achieved.
