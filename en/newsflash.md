## Innovation - daily:

- ### Stradivarius meets Sonowood!

  A great honor for Swiss Wood Solutions! This Stradivari violin from 1721 was equipped by [Wilhelm Geigenbau](http://wilhelm.geigenbau.ag) with a fingerboard and tailpiece made of **Sonowood spruce**. The owner's courage to opt for such an innovative material has paid off. A clear gain in timbre and volume can be observed. The base material is spruce from the canton Grisons (Graubunden, CH),  that we densified into Sonowood spruce.

- ### Martial arts need it extra strong

  That's why this sword is made of our densified wood. It's still a sample, but already getting great reviews. The Budokan is very exciting new territory for us!

- ### Professional photography equipment

  Our densified wood is very durable and stable, perfect for high-end tools that need to last.
