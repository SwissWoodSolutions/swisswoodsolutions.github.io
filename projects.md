## Highlights of our current developments:

- ### Stradivarius meets Sonowood!

  A great honor for Swiss Wood Solutions! This Stradivari violin from 1720 was equipped by [Wilhelm Geigenbau](http://wilhelm.geigenbau.ag) with a fingerboard and tailpiece made of **Sonowood spruce**. The owner's courage to opt for such an innovative material has paid off. A clear gain in timbre and volume can be observed. The base material is spruce from the canton Grisons (Graubunden, CH),  that we densified into Sonowood spruce.

- ### Martial arts need it extra strong

  That's why this sword is made of our densified wood. It's still a sample, but already getting great reviews. The Budokan is very exciting new territory for us!

- ### Sonowood, not only for strings

  Not just string instruments are made of tropical wood parts. Of course also wind instruments such as clarinets or flutes would benefit if they can be produced from an alternative wood source. We are currently fine-tuning **Sonowood** for winds.

- ### Professional photography equipment

  Our densified wood is very durable and stable, perfect for high-end tools that need to last.
