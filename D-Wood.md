The team of Swiss Wood Solutions is driven by the belief that wood can fulfill more needs than it currently does. This is why we have developed a technology to produce a novel wood-based material.  In a multi-step physicochemical process, domestic woods such as spruce or maple are modified. The resulting product __DWood__, derived from densified wood, is a material with inspirational properties. In addition to being environmentally friendly, the technology offers adjustability of a wide range of parameters. No matter if hardness, density or coloration â€“ you choose the properties of your wood.

The technology is applicable to any possible wood specie, depending on the individual requirements of the respective product. The use of maple, beech, ash and spruce has been proven already. Current experiments also include further species such as plum wood.
For the manufacturing of musical instruments, tropical woods are highly esteemed thanks to high hardness and density, advanced dimensional stability, and aesthetical dark coloration. However, excessive and unregulated exploitation has resulted in a rapidly decreasing availability of the material. In addition to the scarcity, increasingly strict governmental regulations further complicate the import and trade of tropical woods.

Accounting for these problems, Swiss Wood Solutions has developed a completely sustainable alternative. In a multi-step physicochemical process, domestic woods such as spruce or maple are modified. The resulting product __DWood__ matches the favorable properties of tropical woods. In terms of sound quality, it even outperforms its counterpart.
