    <main>
      <p>Swiss Wood Solutions was founded in 2016 as a spin-off from ETH Zurich and Empa. We are driven by the belief that wood can fulfill more needs than it currently does. The team fuses the vast knowledge of scientists with diverse educational backgrounds. The team members combine for a unique and complementary set of scientific, technical and commercial skills. The core team includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dr. Oliver Kl√§usler, CEO, more to come</li>
  <li>Dr. Munish Chanana, Co-CEO and Head of R&amp;D, has studied chemistry and acquired profound research experience in hierarchical biological materials, chemical synthesis and physical chemistry of interfaces. Prior to his engagement at Swiss Wood Solutions, he led the group of Hierarchical Nano-Bio Materials at the Institute for Building Materials at ETH Zurich.</li>
  <li>Dr. Philipp Hass, CTO, studied process engineering with focus on wood and fiber material technology. In combination with an apprenticeship as carpenter, he acquired both practical and theoretical wood processing skills. Prior to his engagement at Swiss Wood Solutions, he worked in a postdoctoral position at ETH Zurich and at Empa.</li>
  <li>Karsten Leuker, Sales Manager, studied wood science and technology. He later specialized in importing of wooden flooring. At Swiss Wood Solutions, he is in charge of the distribution channels and engages in close customer interaction.</li>
  <li>Dr. Walter Sonderegger, responsible for quality management, is a forest engineer. He has acquired profound knowledge in wood mechanics, wood physics and hydrothermal compression methods.</li>
