        <h2>Swiss Wood Solutions on TV and Radio</h2>
        <p>In November 2017, CEO Oliver Kläusler gave an insight into the production technology in a live TV broadcast in “Schweiz aktuell” on SRF. The TV report also focused the application of Sonowood in the musical instrument manufacturing. Boris Haug, violin manufacturer from our premium partner Wilhelm Geigenbau in Suhr, showcased the working procedure necessary to incorporate Sonowood into high-end string instruments. Violist Chin-Ting Huang of the Pacific Quartet Vienna was interviewed and stated to be thoroughly happy about her viola containing a fingerboard made from Sonowood. She confirmed the superior sound characteristics of her new instrument.</p>

        <p>In March 2018, Swiss Wood Solutions was featured in a second broadcast in “Schweiz aktuell”. This report focused on the musical manufacturing workshop held with our partner Wilhelm Geigenbau and subsequent concert of the Pacific Quartet Vienna.</p>

        <h2>Swiss Wood Solutions in Print</h2>
          <p>The new technology for production of Sonowood has been very well received and widely applauded in multiple media. In October 2017, the technology was first introduced to a broad public by an article in the magazine EmpaQuarterly. “The technology enables Swiss Wood Solutions to finetune crucial parameters such as color and sound characteristic.” The full article can be accessed here: (https://www.empa.ch/web/s604/swiss-wood-solutions)</p>

          <p>This introductory article quickly gained interest from numerous high-circulation newspapers in Switzerland. Articles in the highly respected Neue Zürcher Zeitung NZZ as well as Blick and Limmattaler Zeitung followed:</p>
