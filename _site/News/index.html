<p>The new technology for production of D-Wood has been very well received and widely applauded in multiple media. In October 2017, the technology was first introduced to a broad public by an article in the magazine EmpaQuarterly. “The technology enables Swiss Wood Solutions to finetune crucial parameters such as color and sound characteristic.” The full article can be accessed here: (https://www.empa.ch/web/s604/swiss-wood-solutions)</p>

<p>This introductory article quickly gained interest from numerous high-circulation newspapers in Switzerland. Articles in the highly respected Neue Zürcher Zeitung NZZ as well as Blick and Limmattaler Zeitung followed. The articles can be accessed here: <em>insert links</em></p>

<p>In November 2017, CEO Oliver Kläusler gave an insight into the production technology in a live TV broadcast in “Schweiz aktuell” on SRF. The TV report also focused the application of D-Wood in the musical instrument manufacturing. Boris Haug, violin manufacturer from our premium partner Wilhelm Geigenbau in Suhr, showcased the working procedure necessary to incorporate D-Wood into high-end stringed instruments. Most importantly, professional violin player Chin-Ting Huang of the Pacific Quartet Vienna was interviewed and stated to be thoroughly happy about her viola containing a fingerboard from D-Wood. She confirmed the superior sound characteristics of her new instrument. The video can be found below.</p>

<p>In March 2018, Swiss Wood Solutions was featured in a second broadcast in “Schweiz aktuell”. This report focused on the musical manufacturing workshop held with our partner Wilhelm Geigenbau and subsequent concert of the Pacific Quartet Vienna.</p>

<p>The extensive media coverage led to a tremendous increase of company awareness. As a consequence, Swiss Wood Solutions was approached by multiple national and international musical instrument manufacturers. This enabled us to establish close contacts with potential future customers and learn from their specific product requirements.</p>
