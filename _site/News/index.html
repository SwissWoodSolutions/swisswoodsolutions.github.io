        <h2>Swiss Wood Solutions on TV and Radio</h2>
        <p>In November 2017, CEO Oliver Kläusler gave an insight into the production technology in a live TV broadcast in “Schweiz aktuell” on SRF. The TV report also focused the application of SonoWood in the musical instrument manufacturing. Boris Haug, violin manufacturer from our premium partner Wilhelm Geigenbau in Suhr, showcased the working procedure necessary to incorporate SonoWood into high-end stringed instruments. Most importantly, professional violin player Chin-Ting Huang of the Pacific Quartet Vienna was interviewed and stated to be thoroughly happy about her viola containing a fingerboard from SonoWood. She confirmed the superior sound characteristics of her new instrument.</p>

        <p>In March 2018, Swiss Wood Solutions was featured in a second broadcast in “Schweiz aktuell”. This report focused on the musical manufacturing workshop held with our partner Wilhelm Geigenbau and subsequent concert of the Pacific Quartet Vienna.</p>
