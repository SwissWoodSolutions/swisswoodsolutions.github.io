    <p>Swiss Wood Solutions AG (SWS) is a spin-off of ETH Zurich and EMPA (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology) in the field of novel wood materials. With an interdisciplinary team of wood scientists with expertise in wood physics, wood chemistry and wood processing and engineering, Swiss Wood Solutions is a "technology developing" and "custom-made solution providing" company.</p>
    <p>With our technologies, we not only want to overcome the problems and obstacles encountered in the traditional application fields of wood materials, but also increase wood’s performance, providing a high-class wood material with well-defined added functionalities precisely tailored to the customers’ demands of the 21st Century, especially in high-end lifestyle and luxurious application fields.</p>
    <p>This will allow us to enter performance-driven markets and market segments. Our first innovation Sonowood comprises a technologically augmented wood, made of European wood species from certified sustainable forests, as an alternative to endangered tropical wood species in their traditional application fields, such as the classical wooden musical instruments. Sonowood not only represents a real wooden substitute material for the highly esteemed and endangered woods species, but with its tunable and modular physical properties, such as hardness, density, dimensional stability, color and acoustics, it will open completely new application fields.
