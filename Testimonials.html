        <h2>What the professionals say</h2>

        <p>«I’m excited about Sonowood. The resulting sound for wooden transverse flutes is excellent, it has an enriching new sound nuance.»
        <br><strong>&mdash; Thomas Aebi, flute manufacturer from Switzerland, 31st August 2018</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>«My Antoniazzi violin now has a Sonowood fingerboard. The articulation, acoustic color and gestures are much clearer. The material inspired me.»
        <br><strong>&mdash; Yuta Takase, violinist at Pacific Quartet Vienna, 30th April 2018</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>«It must not be that a disappearing species such as ebony is still used heavily. The urgency to find a new material was strong. It is wonderful to now have such a high-end, ecologically sustainable material at our disposal.»
        <br><strong>&mdash; Mark Jonathan Wilhem, violin manufacturer from Switzerland, 28th November 2017</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>«The guitar with a fingerboard and bridge from Sonowood possesses a very warm acoustic color. My client is simply thrilled.»
        <br><strong>&mdash; Mauro Bodio, guitar manufacturer from Switzerland, 4th May 2018</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>«Sonowood is a very compact material. Nevertheless it is easier to plane and shape than ebony. A pleasant smooth surface results.»
        <br>
        <strong>&mdash; Philip Ihle, violin manufacturer from London (UK), 2nd March 2018</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>«The viola featuring a Sonowood fingerboard is easier to play in the low-pitched tones and thus allows more artistic freedom. In the high-pitched tones, the viola lost its sharpness and gained softness. Consequently, the articulation is simplified and more tone colors can be played.»<br>
        <strong>&mdash; Sarah Weilenmann, member of Pacific Quartet Vienna, 2nd March 2018</strong>

        <h2 class="align-center-italic">«The sound of my viola has improved thanks to the incorporation of a Sonowood fingerboard. The instrument now sounds warmer, richer and more open. Prior to the change, I was a bit nervous since I did not know what to expect from this novel material. Now I am very happy and relieved.»</h2>

        <strong>&mdash; George Stoppani, violin manufacturer from Manchester (UK), 2nd March 2018</strong></p>
        <hr>

        <p>«The sound of the strings of my violin is much clearer with a fingerboard from Sonowood compared to ebony.»<br>
