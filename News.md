        <h2>Swiss Wood Solutions on TV and Radio</h2>
        <p>
        In November 2017, CEO Oliver Kläusler gave an insight into the production technology in a live TV broadcast in «Schweiz aktuell» on SRF. The TV report also focused the application of Sonowood in the musical instrument manufacturing. Boris Haug, violin manufacturer from our premium partner Wilhelm Geigenbau in Suhr, showcased the working procedure necessary to incorporate Sonowood into high-end string instruments. Violist Chin-Ting Huang of the <a href="http://pacificquartet.com" target="_blank">Pacific Quartet Vienna</a> was interviewed and stated to be thoroughly happy about her viola containing a fingerboard made from Sonowood. She confirmed the superior sound characteristics of her new instrument.
