## What the professionals say

«I’m excited about Sonowood. The resulting sound for wooden transverse
flutes is excellent, it has an enriching new sound nuance.»  
**— Thomas Aebi, flute manufacturer from Switzerland, 31st August 2018**

-----

«My Antoniazzi violin now has a Sonowood fingerboard. The articulation,
acoustic color and gestures are much clearer. The material inspired
me.»  
**— Yuta Takase, violinist at Pacific Quartet Vienna, 30th April 2018**

-----

«It must not be that a disappearing species such as ebony is still used
heavily. The urgency to find a new material was strong. It is wonderful
to now have such a high-end, ecologically sustainable material at our
disposal.»  
**— Mark Jonathan Wilhem, violin manufacturer from Switzerland, 28th
November 2017**

## *«The sound of my viola has improved thanks to the incorporation of a Sonowood fingerboard. The instrument now sounds warmer, richer and more open. Prior to the change, I was a bit nervous since I did not know what to expect from this novel material. Now I am very happy and relieved.»*

**— Chin-Ting Huang, member of the Pacific Quartet Vienna, 28th November
2017**

«The sound of the strings of my violin is much clearer with a fingerboard from Sonowood compared to ebony.»  
**— Eszter Major, member of the Pacific Quartet Vienna, 14th March
2018**

-----

«Sonowood is a very compact material. Nevertheless it is easier to plane and shape than ebony. A pleasant smooth surface results.»  
**— Philip Ihle, violin manufacturer from London (UK), 2nd March 2018**

-----

«The viola featuring a Sonowood fingerboard is easier to play in the
low-pitched tones and thus allows more artistic freedom. In the
high-pitched tones, the viola lost its sharpness and gained softness.
Consequently, the articulation is simplified and more tone colors can be
played.»  
**— Sarah Weilenmann, member of Pacific Quartet Vienna, 2nd March
2018**
