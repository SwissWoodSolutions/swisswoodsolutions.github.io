        <h1>What our clients say</h1>
        <p>Chin-Ting Huang, violist at the Pacific Quartet Vienna: „The sound of my viola has improved thanks to the incorporation of a Sonowood fingerboard. The instrument now sounds warmer, richer and more open. Prior to the change, I was a bit nervous since I did not know what to expect from this novel material. Now I am very happy and relieved.”</p>
        <p> Sarah Weilenmann, cellist at the Pacific Quartet Vienna: „The viola featuring a Sonowood fingerboard is easier to play in the low-pitched tones and thus allows more artistic freedom. In the high-pitched tones, the viola lost its sharpness and gained softness. Consequently, the articulation is simplified and more tone colors can be played.”</p>
        <p>Boris Haug, violin manufacturer from Suhr (Switzerland): “I have not yet seen a material with such a low damping as Sonowood.”</p>
        <p> Philip Ihle, violin manufacturer from London: „Sonowood is a very compact material. Nevertheless it is easier to plane and shape than ebony. A pleasant smooth surface results.”</p>
        <p>Eric Fouilhé, instrument manufacturer from Valence (France): „Sonowood offers such a straightforward workability, it is sensational.“</p>
        <p>George Stoppani, violin manufacturer from Manchester: „Sonowood has the potential to not only match the quality of ebony, but to even excel it.”</p>
