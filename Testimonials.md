        <h2>What the professionals say</h2>
        <p>«I have not yet seen a material with such a low damping as Sonowood.»<br>
        <strong>Boris Haug, violin manufacturer from Suhr, Switzerland</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>«Sonowood is a very compact material. Nevertheless it is easier to plane and shape than ebony. A pleasant smooth surface results.»
        <br><strong>Philip Ihle, violin manufacturer from London</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>«The viola featuring a Sonowood fingerboard is easier to play in the low-pitched tones and thus allows more artistic freedom. In the high-pitched tones, the viola lost its sharpness and gained softness. Consequently, the articulation is simplified and more tone colors can be played.»<br>
        <strong>Sarah Weilenmann, member of Pacific Quartet Vienna</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 class="align-center-italic">«The sound of my viola has improved thanks to the incorporation of a Sonowood fingerboard. The instrument now sounds warmer, richer and more open. Prior to the change, I was a bit nervous since I did not know what to expect from this novel material. Now I am very happy and relieved.»</h2>
