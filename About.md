        <p>Swiss Wood Solutions was founded in 2016 as a spin-off from ETH Zurich and Empa. We are driven by the belief that wood can fulfill more needs than it currently does. The team fuses the vast knowledge of scientists with diverse educational backgrounds. The team members combine for a unique and complementary set of scientific, technical and commercial skills.

                <h3>Dr. Oliver Kläusler, CEO</h3>
                <p>and co-founder of Swiss Wood Solutions. He has studied wood science and technology at the University of Hamburg (Germany) and wrote his thesis at ETH Zurich. Subsequently, he worked as an R&D engineer and project manager in the wood industry in Switzerland, the Czech Republic and the United States. He is the main inventor and developer of the production technologies for two Beaufort products for Audi cars. Oliver Kläusler then received his PhD in the field of high-performance bonded wooden joints for wood constructions from ETH Zurich. Following his promotion, he became research-group leader at Empa Dübendorf and ETH Zurich. </p>
